\begin{description}
	\item \emph{Introduction}
	% High Level, Nontechnical Description Why you should buy this product/listen to
	% this presentation? What is the functionality of the product?

Visigoth is a tool to generate, analyse and visualise Small World
Networks. These are particular kinds of graphs which \emph{look} like naturally
grown networks and share many mathematical properties with them.  For instance,
friendship graphs and graphs of followers in modern web-based ``social
networks'' are Small World Networks.

	\item \emph{Visigoth's functionality}
	%should we add here what is able to do?

As an educational tool Visigoth allows users to explore Small World Networks in
both 2D and 3D and hence can be used as an introduction to them. By exploring 
these networks users will have a firmer, more intuitive grasp of the mathematical 
properties they exhibit.

The networks may be generated using several algorithms, allowing users to
compare their output and its adherence to the properties of Small World
Networks. The network generation algorithms in Visigoth form a smooth
progression in the number of exhibited desired properties from completely random
graphs, generated by the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi algorithm, to fully compliant Small
World Networks, generated by the Preferential Attachment
algorithm. Additionally, Visigoth can connect to social networking platforms
such as Twitter to fetch and display real-world networks.

Users have easy access to common actions such as graph regeneration and node
reshuffling. They can move the graph around, rotate it, generate node specific
statistics and highlight direct node's neighbours. 

Users can also customize the appearance of the generated graph, such as:
change edges and nodes colour, choose a different background, highlight cliques
or highlight selected node and connections with it's direct neighbours.

Finally, Visigoth allows taking snapshots of the graphs and exporting them to image files. The supported formats include PNG and JPEG, which are the image formats supported by most computers.

We encountered a number of difficulties whilst building Visigoth, which we 
over- came by dividing the application into mostly-independent components.
The following sections provide overviews and short descriptions for each component.

\begin{description}
\item \textbf{tests}
The test system is heavily oriented towards functionality testing, checking that user actions cause the expected behaviour.
\item \textbf{GUI}
The GUI is the only user-visible component. It was relies heavily on Qt's widget library and OpenGL.
\item \textbf{GraphScene}
We took an Model-View-Controller approach in Visigoth's design. Whist the GUI system is the view, the GraphScene is the model and encap- sulates the controller.
\item \textbf{Algorithms}
The last component of Visigoth are the algorithms. All the individual algorithms implement the Algorithm interface, which allows them to be easily plugged into the GraphScene.
\end{description}

Work was divided between team members such that each would focus on developing
a particular component and reviewing another. We chose an iterative development 
model, where each iteration consisted of adding a small number of features to the
existing product.

We have had to ensure that no bugs crept into the master branch. Towards this 
goal, no changes are merged into master until at least another member of the 
team reviews them. Through this practice of peer review the whole team has stayed
informed on the current state of the project in addition to exposing and fixing 
bugs missed by the original code author. 

To further promote group awareness of the complete state of the project we held
frequent short meetings true to the idea of \emph{scrum}. These were whole-group
meetings held every few days, in which team members shared comments on what
features they were working on at the time and the future outlook of the project.

While our development methodology was not test-driven or focused on usability, we continuously tested the software on volunteers and towards the end of each iteration,
we held meetings with our client. These tests and meetings uncovered a few 
problems, which eventually lead to small redesigns.

	\item \emph{Validation}
	%D. Validation and Conclusions How did you validate your product? 

	\item \emph{Conclusions}
	%Was the project successful? What did you learn? What might you have done
	% differently?

Our team has thoroughly enjoyed the process that led to the creation of Visigoth. We managed to get the first results very quickly and then added features and refined the product in the successive months. As of today, we are very proud of the result and we plan to release it to the wider public in the near future.

While we could have improved in some areas, the development of Visigoth has been very successful in what matters more: constantly delivering, on time, the features requested by the client while maintaining a clean and maintainable code base. We went even further than that and proposed features of our own which were all implemented. For this reason we are satisfied not only with the end result, but also with how smooth the development process was, and we think our client is satisfied as well.
