	\item \emph{Introduction}
	% High Level, Nontechnical Description Why you should buy this product/listen to
	% this presentation? What is the functionality of the product?

Visigoth is a tool to generate, analyse and visualise Small World
Networks. These are particular kinds of graphs which \emph{look} like naturally
grown networks and share many mathematical properties with them.  For instance,
friendship graphs and graphs of followers in modern web-based ``social
networks'' are Small World Networks.

	\item \emph{Visigoth's functionality}
	%should we add here what is able to do?

As an educational tool Visigoth allows users to explore Small World Networks in
both 2D and 3D and hence can be used as an introduction to them. By exploring 
these networks users will have a firmer, more intuitive grasp of the mathematical 
properties they exhibit.

The networks may be generated using several algorithms, allowing users to
compare their output and its adherence to the properties of Small World
Networks. The network generation algorithms in Visigoth form a smooth
progression in the number of exhibited desired properties from completely random
graphs, generated by the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi algorithm, to fully compliant Small
World Networks, generated by the Preferential Attachment
algorithm. Additionally, Visigoth can connect to social networking platforms
such as Twitter to fetch and display real-world networks.

Users have easy access to common actions such as graph regeneration and node
reshuffling. They can move the graph around, rotate it, generate node specific
statistics and highlight direct node's neighbours. 

Users can also customize the appearance of the generated graph, such as:
change edges and nodes colour, choose a different background, highlight cliques
or highlight selected node and connections with it's direct neighbours.

Finally, Visigoth allows taking snapshots of the graphs and exporting them to image files. The supported formats include PNG and JPEG, which are the image formats supported by most computers.
