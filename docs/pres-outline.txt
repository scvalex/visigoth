Introduction (3:00 min, Alex)
============

This is Visigoth and it helps visualising SWNs.
[make sure audience understands that this is a desktop application that visualises stuff, graphs, FAST]

What are SWNs?
They are everywhere, they surround us.
A kind of network that....
[briefly, no maths at all]

Tag cloud.
Erdos-Renyi, Barabasi-Albert.
OpenGL, Twitter.
amazing, incredible
[make them understand that we have several algos, we are FAST, we are multiplatform]


Maths (Ingrid)
=====

What is a graph? (0:30 min)

Small world effect: history (1:30 min)

Comparisons (2:00 min):
------------
1. Low avg path length
2. high clustering coefficient [cliques, maybe compare to social life?]
3. scale-free network [Power law distribution, few nodes with a lot of connections (hubs), lot of nodes with few connections]

GRAPHICAL EXAMPLES? - picture of the internet / proteins (0:30 min)


Algorithms (2:30 min, Marc):
==========
Checklist showing which properties the algo fulfils

		1	2	3	remarks
--------------------------------------------------
Erdos-Renyi	n	n	n	random!
Bipartite	y	n	n	bipartite, wut!
Watts-Strogatz	y	y	n	the ring lattice thingy that gets rewired
Barabasi-Albert	y	n	y	we're getting there... but the clusters are missing :(
[get ready for it...]
PAwC		y	y	y	FINALLY!

[skip statistics, show them in demo]


Engineering
===========
[Qt, C++, OpenGL, Spring Model Algos]

joke about c++, qt

Qt (2:30 min, Alex)
 -> may not be as hyped as node.js but after 15 years of dev it seems to work. Well, that's what they say.

Graph drawing, FADE (Francesco, 2:30 min)

C++ (Francesco, 1:30 min)
ugly but utilitarianist
[compare to GLib...]

OpenGL (Max, 1:30 min)


DEMO (5:00 min, Max)
====
UI options, Qt, OpenGL


Conclusion (2:00 min, Francesco)
==========
Stress the delivering focus attitude of our team and its fulfilment
